# TigerIsland
CEN3031 Team Q's Project

## Features
There are no features missing as far as game functionality goes. We divided up a turn into a `TileAction` and a `BuildAction`. Our AI strategy prioritizes as follows:

###### TileAction

###### BuildAction

## Instructions
1. If you're running from within IntelliJ:
  ```
  Run > Edit Configurations > Application > TigerIslandClient
  ```
 Â **Program Arguments:** `<host_name> <port> <username> <password> <tournament_password>`
  
2. If you've created a .jar file:
```java
java MyJarFile.jar <host_name> <port> <username> <password> <tournament_password>
```

## Git Workflow
1. `git checkout master` // Get on your local `master` branch
2. `git fetch upstream` // Fetch the team's repo
3. `git rebase upstream/master` // Rebase the team's changes (you want to keep all the current history!)
4. `git branch -l "myBranchName"` // Create a new local branch for the changes you want to make
5. `git checkout myBranchName` // Get on your newly created branch
6. Make some changes...
7. `git add .` // Add the changes. The . is just a file path, this add's the current directory
8. `git commit -m "I made some changes"` // Commit the changes, leave a descriptive message
9. `git push origin myBranchName` // Push your changes to your **remote** fork

Now, go to the [team's repo](https://github.com/CEN3031Q/TigerIsland) and submit a Pull Request. It'll get merged when we see all is good!
